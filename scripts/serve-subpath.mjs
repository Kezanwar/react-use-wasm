/**
 * Serves the built demo from a sub-directory, the way GitHub Pages does.
 *
 * Pages publishes at /<repo>/, not /, so any absolute asset path such as
 * "/math.wasm" resolves to the domain root and 404s. That breaks only in
 * production, which is the worst place to find out, so e2e/subpath.spec.ts
 * exercises it against this server.
 *
 *   /react-use-wasm/  the real thing, .wasm served as application/wasm
 *   /badmime/         .wasm served as octet-stream, so the test can prove
 *                     the hooks fall back from compileStreaming to compile
